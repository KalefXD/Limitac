# Limitac

**Limitac** is a variation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game with additional rules that introduce strategy and limitations. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

* Custom game rules:

  * **Move Number Display**: Show the order in which marks were placed.
  * **3-Mark Limit**: Each player can only have 3 marks on the board. Placing a 4th removes the oldest one.
  * **Move Limit**: Players can only place marks adjacent to the previous move.
  * **Time Limit** (in development): Forces random placement if the player takes too long.
* Language Support: Spanish and English versions available
* Game state is saved on page unload and restored on reload

## How to Use

2. Use the "Options" panel to toggle game rules.
3. Click on any cell to place your mark.
4. Click "Rest" to restart the game.
