## What makes this game special?

- Each player can have only three marks (X or O) on the board at the same time (a maximum of 6 marks in total).
- If a player already has three marks and wants to make a new move, their oldest mark is automatically removed from the board (each mark shows a small number indicating the order it was placed).
- You can switch the language from the top menu!
