# Limitac
A different Tic Tac Toe with a new rule: **only three marks per player!**

Play it here:
- [English version](https://kalefxd.github.io/Limitac/)
- [Spanish version](https://kalefxd.github.io/Limitac/es/)  


## What makes this game special?

- Each player can have only three marks (X or O) on the board at the same time (a maximum of 6 marks in total).
- If a player already has three marks and wants to make a new move, their oldest mark is automatically removed from the board (each mark shows a small number indicating the order it was placed).
